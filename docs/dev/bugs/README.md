# Bugs (persistent)

This folder contains the **canonical** list of known bugs and their detailed reports.

- The single source of truth list is: `BUG_INDEX.md`
- Each bug has its own file in `reports/`
- Create new bug reports using `templates/BUG_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md`

Conventions:
- Bugs are named: `BUG-0001-short-slug.md`
- Use priority P0/P1/P2 aligned with the project rubric
